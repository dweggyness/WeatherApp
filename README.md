# Weather App

A weather app made with ReactJS. Weather data obtained from DarkSky's API and is limited to 1000 calls a day. Location of user is
obtained using a React plugin "Geolocated".

Neat things
- Has two different backgrounds based on the time of day! Dark blue for early morning & after sunset, and light blue during daytime.


Some tweaks that I might make in the future is :
- Show the current location of the user at the top such as "Kimberly Street, Newshire" as a UI improvement.
- Allow the daily weather tabs to be pressed to obtain a similiar carousel hourly timeline of the 24 hours during that day.
